It\\u2019s a great way to discover patterns in stock prices or trading behaviors. \\n\\nTo get started, think about what features you would like to use from the stock data. Common features could include historical prices, trading volume, or even technical indicators like moving averages. \\n\\nOnce you have your dataset ready, you can apply the K-Means algorithm to group similar stocks based on those features. Remember, the algorithm will partition the stocks into \\\\( k \\\\) clusters, where each stock is assigned to the cluster with the nearest centroid. \\n\\nDo you have a specific stock dataset in mind, or are you looking for guidance on how to choose the right features?\\nStudent: For the NVIDIA dataset I need to do.

Recall our stock data: Code   df.head()__ | TSLA | NVDA ---|---|--- Date | | 2023-01-03 | 108.099998 | 14.315 2023-01-04 | 113.639999 | 14.749 2023-01-05 | 110.339996 | 14.265 2023-01-06 | 113.059998 | 14.859 2023-01-09 | 119.769997 | 15.628 Each column can be treated as a vector. So: * Let\\u2019s say that our data frame `df` is represented as a matrix \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(D\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), * and that `df['TSLA']` are observations of some random variable \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), * and `df['NVDA']` are observations of some random variable \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(Y\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). Let \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(D\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) have \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) rows (i.e., \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) observations). Now, let us subtract from each column its mean, to form a new matrix \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\tilde{D}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). In the new matrix \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\tilde{D}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), every column has zero mean. Then notice the following: the Covariance matrix of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\((X, Y)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is simply \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\\\\\tilde{D}^T\\\\\\\\tilde{D}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). To see this compute \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[\\\\\\\\begin{align*} \\\\\\\\text{Cov}(X,Y) &= E\\\\\\\\left[(X-\\\\\\\\mu_X)(Y-\\\\\\\\mu_Y)\\\\\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\\\\\frac{1}{m} \\\\\\\\sum_i (\\\\\\\\tilde{D}_{i1} \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\\\\\tilde{D}_{i2})\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\\\\\;\\\\\\\\tilde{d}_1^T\\\\\\\\tilde{d}_2, \\\\\\\\end{align*}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] where \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\tilde{d}_1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\tilde{d}_2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) are the columns of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\tilde{D}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). This shows that **covariance is actually an inner product** between normalized observation vectors. ## Low and High Variability Historically, most sources of random variation that have concerned statisticians are instances of low variability. The original roots of probability in the study of games of chance, and later in the study of biology and medicine, have mainly studied objects with low variability. Note that by \\u201clow variability\\u201d I don\\u2019t mean that such variability is unimportant. Some examples of random variation in this category are: * the heights of adult humans, * the number of trees per unit area in a mature forest, * the sum of 10 rolls of a die, * the time between emission of subatomic particles from a radioactive material. In each of these cases, there are a range of values that are \\u201ctypical,\\u201d and there is a clear threshold above what is typical, that essentially never occurs. On the other hand, there are some situations in which variability is quite different. In these cases, there is no real \\u201ctypical\\u201d range of values, and arbitrarily large values can occur with non-negligible frequency. Some examples in this category are * the distribution of wealth among individuals in society, * the sizes of human settlements, * the areas burnt in forest fires, * the runs of gains and losses in various financial markets over time, * and the number of collaborators a scholar has over their lifetime. ### Example > The banking system (betting against rare events) just lost [more than] 1 > Trillion dollars (so far) on a single error, more than was ever earned in > the history of banking. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, September 2008 ![](figs/derivatives-portfolio-variation.png) An example of a run of observations showing high variability. This figure shows the daily variations in a derivatives portfolio over the time-frame 1988-2008. About 99% of the variation over the 20 years occurs in a single day (the day the European Monetary System collapsed). # Important Distributions ## Important Distributions Now we will review certain distributions that come up over and over again in typical situations. ### The Bernoulli Distribution An experiment of a particularly simple type is one in which there are only two possible outcomes, such as * head or tail * success or failure * defective or non-defective component * patient recovers or does not recover Each distribution has one or more _parameters_. Parameters are settings that control the distribution. A Bernoulli distribution has one parameter, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), which is the probability that the random variable is equal to 1. **Definition.** It is said that a random variable \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) has a _Bernoulli distribution_ with parameter \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\((0\\\\\\\\leq p \\\\\\\\leq 1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) can take only the values 0 and 1 and the corresponding probabilities are \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[P(X=1) = p \\\\\\\\: \\\\\\\\text{ and } \\\\\\\\: P(X=0) = 1-p.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] Note that there is a particularly concise way of writing the above definition: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[ p(x) = P(X=x) = p^x (1-p)^{(1-x)} \\\\\\\\: \\\\\\\\text{ for } \\\\\\\\: x = 0 \\\\\\\\text{ and } x=1.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] The mean of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and the variance of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p(1-p)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). ### The Binomial Distribution The binomial distribution considers precisely \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) Bernoulli trials. Each trial has the probability of a success equal to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) are the parameters of the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution answers the question \\u201cWhat is the probability there will be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) successes in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) trials?\\u201d **Definition.** If \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) represents the number of successes that occur in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) trials, then \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is said to have a _binomial distribution_ with parameters \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\((0\\\\\\\\leq p \\\\\\\\leq 1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). The PMF of a binomial random variable is given by \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[p(k) = P(X=k) = \\\\\\\\binom{N}{k}\\\\\\\\; p^k\\\\\\\\; (1-p)^{N-k} \\\\\\\\: \\\\\\\\text{ for } k=0,1,\\\\\\\\ldots,N.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] The validity of the above PMF can be verified as follows. First we notice, that, by the assumed independence of trials, for any **given** sequence of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) successes and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N-k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) failures, the probability is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p^k \\\\\\\\;(1-p)^{N-k}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). Then there are \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\binom{N}{k}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) different sequences of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) outcomes leading to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) successes and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N-k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) failures. The mean of the Binomial distribution is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(pN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), and its variance is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p(1-p)N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). The PMF of the Binomial distribution with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N = 10\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p=0.3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is shown below. Code   from scipy.stats import binom  p = 0.3  x = np.arange(binom.ppf(0.01, 10, p), binom.ppf(0.9995, 10, p))  plt.ylim([0, 0.4])  plt.xlim([-0.5, max(x)+0.5])  plt.plot(x, binom.pmf(x, 10, p), 'bo', ms=8, label = 'binom pmf')  plt.vlines(x, 0, binom.pmf(x, 10, p), colors='b', lw = 5, alpha=0.6)  plt.title(f'Binomial PDF, $p$ = {p}, $N$ = 10', size=14)  plt.xlabel(r'$k$', size=14)  plt.ylabel(r'$P(X = k)$', size=14)  plt.show()__ ![](03-Probability-and-Statistics-Refresher_files/figure- html/cell-11-output-1.png) ### The Geometric Distribution The geometric distribution concerns Bernoulli trials as well. It has only one parameter \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), the probability of success. The geometric distribution answers the question: \\u201cWhat is the probability it takes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) trials to obtain the first success?\\u201d **Definition.** It is said that a random variable \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) has a _geometric distribution_ with parameter \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\((0\\\\\\\\leq p \\\\\\\\leq 1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) has a discrete distribution with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[ p(k) = P(X = k) = p(1-p)^{k-1} \\\\\\\\qquad \\\\\\\\text{for} \\\\\\\\: k \\\\\\\\geq 1.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] The mean of the geometric distribution is equal to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and its variance is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\frac{1-p}{p^2}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). An example of the geometric PMF is given below. Code   from scipy.stats import geom  p = 0.3  x = np.arange(geom.ppf(0.01, p), geom.ppf(0.995, p))  plt.ylim([0, 0.4])  plt.xlim([0.5, max(x)])  plt.plot(x, geom.pmf(x, p), 'bo', ms=8, label = 'geom pmf')  plt.vlines(x, 0, geom.pmf(x, p), colors='b', lw = 5, alpha = 0.6)  plt.title(f'Geometric PDF, $p$ = {p}', size=14)  plt.xlabel(r'$k$', size=14)  plt.ylabel(r'$P(X = k)$', size=14)  plt.show()__ ![](03-Probability-and-Statistics-Refresher_files/figure- html/cell-12-output-1.png) ### The Poisson Distribution Although the Bernoulli trials underlie all of the previous distributions, they do not form the basis for the Poisson distribution.

Let \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(D\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) have \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) rows (i.e., \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) observations).

Note that by \\u201clow variability\\u201d I don\\u2019t mean that such variability is unimportant. Some examples of random variation in this category are: * the heights of adult humans, * the number of trees per unit area in a mature forest, * the sum of 10 rolls of a die, * the time between emission of subatomic particles from a radioactive material. In each of these cases, there are a range of values that are \\u201ctypical,\\u201d and there is a clear threshold above what is typical, that essentially never occurs. On the other hand, there are some situations in which variability is quite different. In these cases, there is no real \\u201ctypical\\u201d range of values, and arbitrarily large values can occur with non-negligible frequency. Some examples in this category are * the distribution of wealth among individuals in society, * the sizes of human settlements, * the areas burnt in forest fires, * the runs of gains and losses in various financial markets over time, * and the number of collaborators a scholar has over their lifetime. ### Example > The banking system (betting against rare events) just lost [more than] 1 > Trillion dollars (so far) on a single error, more than was ever earned in > the history of banking. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, September 2008 ![](figs/derivatives-portfolio-variation.png) An example of a run of observations showing high variability. This figure shows the daily variations in a derivatives portfolio over the time-frame 1988-2008. About 99% of the variation over the 20 years occurs in a single day (the day the European Monetary System collapsed). # Important Distributions ## Important Distributions Now we will review certain distributions that come up over and over again in typical situations. ### The Bernoulli Distribution An experiment of a particularly simple type is one in which there are only two possible outcomes, such as * head or tail * success or failure * defective or non-defective component * patient recovers or does not recover Each distribution has one or more _parameters_. Parameters are settings that control the distribution. A Bernoulli distribution has one parameter, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), which is the probability that the random variable is equal to 1. **Definition.** It is said that a random variable \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) has a _Bernoulli distribution_ with parameter \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\((0\\\\\\\\leq p \\\\\\\\leq 1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) can take only the values 0 and 1 and the corresponding probabilities are \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[P(X=1) = p \\\\\\\\: \\\\\\\\text{ and } \\\\\\\\: P(X=0) = 1-p.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] Note that there is a particularly concise way of writing the above definition: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[ p(x) = P(X=x) = p^x (1-p)^{(1-x)} \\\\\\\\: \\\\\\\\text{ for } \\\\\\\\: x = 0 \\\\\\\\text{ and } x=1.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] The mean of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and the variance of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p(1-p)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). ### The Binomial Distribution The binomial distribution considers precisely \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) Bernoulli trials. Each trial has the probability of a success equal to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) are the parameters of the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution answers the question \\u201cWhat is the probability there will be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) successes in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) trials?\\u201d **Definition.** If \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) represents the number of successes that occur in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) trials, then \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is said to have a _binomial distribution_ with parameters \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\((0\\\\\\\\leq p \\\\\\\\leq 1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). The PMF of a binomial random variable is given by \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[p(k) = P(X=k) = \\\\\\\\binom{N}{k}\\\\\\\\; p^k\\\\\\\\; (1-p)^{N-k} \\\\\\\\: \\\\\\\\text{ for } k=0,1,\\\\\\\\ldots,N.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] The validity of the above PMF can be verified as follows. First we notice, that, by the assumed independence of trials, for any **given** sequence of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) successes and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N-k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) failures, the probability is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p^k \\\\\\\\;(1-p)^{N-k}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). Then there are \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\binom{N}{k}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) different sequences of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) outcomes leading to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) successes and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N-k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) failures. The mean of the Binomial distribution is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(pN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), and its variance is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p(1-p)N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). The PMF of the Binomial distribution with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N = 10\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p=0.3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is shown below. Code   from scipy.stats import binom  p = 0.3  x = np.arange(binom.ppf(0.01, 10, p), binom.ppf(0.9995, 10, p))  plt.ylim([0, 0.4])  plt.xlim([-0.5, max(x)+0.5])  plt.plot(x, binom.pmf(x, 10, p), 'bo', ms=8, label = 'binom pmf')  plt.vlines(x, 0, binom.pmf(x, 10, p), colors='b', lw = 5, alpha=0.6)  plt.title(f'Binomial PDF, $p$ = {p}, $N$ = 10', size=14)  plt.xlabel(r'$k$', size=14)  plt.ylabel(r'$P(X = k)$', size=14)  plt.show()__ ![](03-Probability-and-Statistics-Refresher_files/figure- html/cell-11-output-1.png) ### The Geometric Distribution The geometric distribution concerns Bernoulli trials as well. It has only one parameter \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), the probability of success. The geometric distribution answers the question: \\u201cWhat is the probability it takes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) trials to obtain the first success?\\u201d **Definition.** It is said that a random variable \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) has a _geometric distribution_ with parameter \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\((0\\\\\\\\leq p \\\\\\\\leq 1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) has a discrete distribution with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[ p(k) = P(X = k) = p(1-p)^{k-1} \\\\\\\\qquad \\\\\\\\text{for} \\\\\\\\: k \\\\\\\\geq 1.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] The mean of the geometric distribution is equal to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and its variance is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\frac{1-p}{p^2}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). An example of the geometric PMF is given below. Code   from scipy.stats import geom  p = 0.3  x = np.arange(geom.ppf(0.01, p), geom.ppf(0.995, p))  plt.ylim([0, 0.4])  plt.xlim([0.5, max(x)])  plt.plot(x, geom.pmf(x, p), 'bo', ms=8, label = 'geom pmf')  plt.vlines(x, 0, geom.pmf(x, p), colors='b', lw = 5, alpha = 0.6)  plt.title(f'Geometric PDF, $p$ = {p}', size=14)  plt.xlabel(r'$k$', size=14)  plt.ylabel(r'$P(X = k)$', size=14)  plt.show()__ ![](03-Probability-and-Statistics-Refresher_files/figure- html/cell-12-output-1.png) ### The Poisson Distribution Although the Bernoulli trials underlie all of the previous distributions, they do not form the basis for the Poisson distribution.

This figure shows the daily variations in a derivatives portfolio over the time-frame 1988-2008. About 99% of the variation over the 20 years occurs in a single day (the day the European Monetary System collapsed). # Important Distributions ## Important Distributions Now we will review certain distributions that come up over and over again in typical situations. ### The Bernoulli Distribution An experiment of a particularly simple type is one in which there are only two possible outcomes, such as * head or tail * success or failure * defective or non-defective component * patient recovers or does not recover Each distribution has one or more _parameters_. Parameters are settings that control the distribution. A Bernoulli distribution has one parameter, \\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\), which is the probability that the random variable is equal to 1. **Definition.** It is said that a random variable \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\) has a _Bernoulli distribution_ with parameter \\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\) \\\\\\\\((0\\\\leq p \\\\leq 1)\\\\\\\\) if \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\) can take only the values 0 and 1 and the corresponding probabilities are \\\\\\\\[P(X=1) = p \\\\: \\\\text{ and } \\\\: P(X=0) = 1-p.\\\\\\\\] Note that there is a particularly concise way of writing the above definition: \\\\\\\\[ p(x) = P(X=x) = p^x (1-p)^{(1-x)} \\\\: \\\\text{ for } \\\\: x = 0 \\\\text{ and } x=1.\\\\\\\\] The mean of a \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\) is \\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\) and the variance of \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\) is \\\\\\\\(p(1-p)\\\\\\\\). ### The Binomial Distribution The binomial distribution considers precisely \\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\) Bernoulli trials. Each trial has the probability of a success equal to \\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\). \\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\) are the parameters of the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution answers the question \\u201cWhat is the probability there will be \\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\) successes in \\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\) trials?\\u201d **Definition.** If \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\) represents the number of successes that occur in \\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\) trials, then \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\) is said to have a _binomial distribution_ with parameters \\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\) \\\\\\\\((0\\\\leq p \\\\leq 1)\\\\\\\\). The PMF of a binomial random variable is given by \\\\\\\\[p(k) = P(X=k) = \\\\binom{N}{k}\\\\; p^k\\\\; (1-p)^{N-k} \\\\: \\\\text{ for } k=0,1,\\\\ldots,N.\\\\\\\\] The validity of the above PMF can be verified as follows. First we notice, that, by the assumed independence of trials, for any **given** sequence of \\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\) successes and \\\\\\\\(N-k\\\\\\\\) failures, the probability is \\\\\\\\(p^k \\\\;(1-p)^{N-k}\\\\\\\\). Then there are \\\\\\\\(\\\\binom{N}{k}\\\\\\\\) different sequences of the \\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\) outcomes leading to \\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\) successes and \\\\\\\\(N-k\\\\\\\\) failures. The mean of the Binomial distribution is \\\\\\\\(pN\\\\\\\\), and its variance is \\\\\\\\(p(1-p)N\\\\\\\\). The PMF of the Binomial distribution with \\\\\\\\(N = 10\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(p=0.3\\\\\\\\) is shown below.

These can provide insights into market trends.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you've decided on your features, you can run the K-Means algorithm. Remember, you\\u2019ll need to pick a value for \\\\\\\\( k \\\\\\\\), the number of clusters, which can often be determined through techniques like the Elbow Method. \\\\n\\\\nAfter clustering, take a look at how the stocks are grouped and see if you can identify any patterns or trends.

It\\u2019s a great way to discover patterns in stock prices or trading behaviors. \\n\\nTo get started, think about what features you would like to use from the stock data. Common features could include historical prices, trading volume, or even technical indicators like moving averages. \\n\\nOnce you have your dataset ready, you can apply the K-Means algorithm to group similar stocks based on those features. Remember, the algorithm will partition the stocks into \\\\\\\\( k \\\\\\\\) clusters, where each stock is assigned to the cluster with the nearest centroid. \\n\\nDo you have a specific stock dataset in mind, or are you looking for guidance on how to choose the right features?\\nStudent: For the NVIDIA dataset I need to do. Just give me an idea\\nAI Tutor: Great choice with the NVIDIA dataset! To start off with K-Means clustering, think about what aspects of NVIDIA\\u2019s stock data you want to analyze. Here are a few ideas to get your creativity flowing:\\n\\n1. **Historical Prices**: You could use daily closing prices or daily returns to see how the stock behaves over time.\\n\\n2. **Trading Volume**: Including trading volume can help you understand how liquidity affects price clustering.\\n\\n3. **Technical Indicators**: Consider calculating indicators like moving averages or Relative Strength Index (RSI). These can provide insights into market trends.\\n\\nOnce you've decided on your features, you can run the K-Means algorithm. Remember, you\\u2019ll need to pick a value for \\\\\\\\( k \\\\\\\\), the number of clusters, which can often be determined through techniques like the Elbow Method. \\n\\nAfter clustering, take a look at how the stocks are grouped and see if you can identify any patterns or trends. What do you think? Do any specific features stand out to you that you might want to use?\\n\\nContext:\\n#### Let's take a look at the data types present in the dataset. ```python df.dtypes ``` ```python df.columns ```\\n\\nWe will also typically organize the observations into a vector. Recall our stock data: Code   df.head()__ | TSLA | NVDA ---|---|--- Date | | 2023-01-03 | 108.099998 | 14.315 2023-01-04 | 113.639999 | 14.749 2023-01-05 | 110.339996 | 14.265 2023-01-06 | 113.059998 | 14.859 2023-01-09 | 119.769997 | 15.628 Each column can be treated as a vector. So: * Let\\u2019s say that our data frame `df` is represented as a matrix \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(D\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), * and that `df['TSLA']` are observations of some random variable \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), * and `df['NVDA']` are observations of some random variable \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(Y\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). Let \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(D\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) have \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) rows (i.e., \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) observations). Now, let us subtract from each column its mean, to form a new matrix \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\tilde{D}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). In the new matrix \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\tilde{D}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), every column has zero mean. Then notice the following: the Covariance matrix of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\((X, Y)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is simply \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\\\\\tilde{D}^T\\\\\\\\tilde{D}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). To see this compute \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[\\\\\\\\begin{align*} \\\\\\\\text{Cov}(X,Y) &= E\\\\\\\\left[(X-\\\\\\\\mu_X)(Y-\\\\\\\\mu_Y)\\\\\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\\\\\frac{1}{m} \\\\\\\\sum_i (\\\\\\\\tilde{D}_{i1} \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\\\\\tilde{D}_{i2})\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\\\\\;\\\\\\\\tilde{d}_1^T\\\\\\\\tilde{d}_2, \\\\\\\\end{align*}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] where \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\tilde{d}_1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\tilde{d}_2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) are the columns of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\tilde{D}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). This shows that **covariance is actually an inner product** between normalized observation vectors. ## Low and High Variability Historically, most sources of random variation that have concerned statisticians are instances of low variability. The original roots of probability in the study of games of chance, and later in the study of biology and medicine, have mainly studied objects with low variability. Note that by \\u201clow variability\\u201d I don\\u2019t mean that such variability is unimportant. Some examples of random variation in this category are: * the heights of adult humans, * the number of trees per unit area in a mature forest, * the sum of 10 rolls of a die, * the time between emission of subatomic particles from a radioactive material. In each of these cases, there are a range of values that are \\u201ctypical,\\u201d and there is a clear threshold above what is typical, that essentially never occurs. On the other hand, there are some situations in which variability is quite different. In these cases, there is no real \\u201ctypical\\u201d range of values, and arbitrarily large values can occur with non-negligible frequency. Some examples in this category are * the distribution of wealth among individuals in society, * the sizes of human settlements, * the areas burnt in forest fires, * the runs of gains and losses in various financial markets over time, * and the number of collaborators a scholar has over their lifetime. ### Example > The banking system (betting against rare events) just lost [more than] 1 > Trillion dollars (so far) on a single error, more than was ever earned in > the history of banking. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, September 2008 ![](figs/derivatives-portfolio-variation.png) An example of a run of observations showing high variability. This figure shows the daily variations in a derivatives portfolio over the time-frame 1988-2008. About 99% of the variation over the 20 years occurs in a single day (the day the European Monetary System collapsed). # Important Distributions ## Important Distributions Now we will review certain distributions that come up over and over again in typical situations. ### The Bernoulli Distribution An experiment of a particularly simple type is one in which there are only two possible outcomes, such as * head or tail * success or failure * defective or non-defective component * patient recovers or does not recover Each distribution has one or more _parameters_. Parameters are settings that control the distribution. A Bernoulli distribution has one parameter, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), which is the probability that the random variable is equal to 1. **Definition.** It is said that a random variable \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) has a _Bernoulli distribution_ with parameter \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\((0\\\\\\\\leq p \\\\\\\\leq 1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) can take only the values 0 and 1 and the corresponding probabilities are \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[P(X=1) = p \\\\\\\\: \\\\\\\\text{ and } \\\\\\\\: P(X=0) = 1-p.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] Note that there is a particularly concise way of writing the above definition: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[ p(x) = P(X=x) = p^x (1-p)^{(1-x)} \\\\\\\\: \\\\\\\\text{ for } \\\\\\\\: x = 0 \\\\\\\\text{ and } x=1.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] The mean of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and the variance of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p(1-p)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). ### The Binomial Distribution The binomial distribution considers precisely \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) Bernoulli trials. Each trial has the probability of a success equal to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) are the parameters of the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution answers the question \\u201cWhat is the probability there will be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) successes in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) trials?\\u201d **Definition.** If \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) represents the number of successes that occur in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) trials, then \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is said to have a _binomial distribution_ with parameters \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\((0\\\\\\\\leq p \\\\\\\\leq 1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). The PMF of a binomial random variable is given by \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[p(k) = P(X=k) = \\\\\\\\binom{N}{k}\\\\\\\\; p^k\\\\\\\\; (1-p)^{N-k} \\\\\\\\: \\\\\\\\text{ for } k=0,1,\\\\\\\\ldots,N.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] The validity of the above PMF can be verified as follows. First we notice, that, by the assumed independence of trials, for any **given** sequence of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) successes and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N-k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) failures, the probability is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p^k \\\\\\\\;(1-p)^{N-k}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). Then there are \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\binom{N}{k}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) different sequences of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) outcomes leading to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) successes and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N-k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) failures. The mean of the Binomial distribution is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(pN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), and its variance is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p(1-p)N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). The PMF of the Binomial distribution with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N = 10\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p=0.3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is shown below.

It has only one parameter \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), the probability of success. The geometric distribution answers the question: \\u201cWhat is the probability it takes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) trials to obtain the first success?\\u201d **Definition.** It is said that a random variable \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) has a _geometric distribution_ with parameter \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\((0\\\\\\\\leq p \\\\\\\\leq 1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) has a discrete distribution with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[ p(k) = P(X = k) = p(1-p)^{k-1} \\\\\\\\qquad \\\\\\\\text{for} \\\\\\\\: k \\\\\\\\geq 1.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] The mean of the geometric distribution is equal to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and its variance is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\frac{1-p}{p^2}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\).

Common features could include historical prices, trading volume, or even technical indicators like moving averages. \\n\\nOnce you have your dataset ready, you can apply the K-Means algorithm to group similar stocks based on those features. Remember, the algorithm will partition the stocks into \\\\( k \\\\) clusters, where each stock is assigned to the cluster with the nearest centroid. \\n\\nDo you have a specific stock dataset in mind, or are you looking for guidance on how to choose the right features?\\nStudent: For the NVIDIA dataset I need to do. Just give me an idea\\nAI Tutor: Great choice with the NVIDIA dataset! To start off with K-Means clustering, think about what aspects of NVIDIA\\u2019s stock data you want to analyze. Here are a few ideas to get your creativity flowing:\\n\\n1. **Historical Prices**: You could use daily closing prices or daily returns to see how the stock behaves over time.\\n\\n2. **Trading Volume**: Including trading volume can help you understand how liquidity affects price clustering.\\n\\n3. **Technical Indicators**: Consider calculating indicators like moving averages or Relative Strength Index (RSI). These can provide insights into market trends.\\n\\nOnce you've decided on your features, you can run the K-Means algorithm. Remember, you\\u2019ll need to pick a value for \\\\( k \\\\), the number of clusters, which can often be determined through techniques like the Elbow Method. \\n\\nAfter clustering, take a look at how the stocks are grouped and see if you can identify any patterns or trends. What do you think? Do any specific features stand out to you that you might want to use?\\n\\nContext:\\n#### Let's take a look at the data types present in the dataset. ```python df.dtypes ``` ```python df.columns ```\\n\\nWe will also typically organize the observations into a vector. Recall our stock data: Code   df.head()__ | TSLA | NVDA ---|---|--- Date | | 2023-01-03 | 108.099998 | 14.315 2023-01-04 | 113.639999 | 14.749 2023-01-05 | 110.339996 | 14.265 2023-01-06 | 113.059998 | 14.859 2023-01-09 | 119.769997 | 15.628 Each column can be treated as a vector. So: * Let\\u2019s say that our data frame `df` is represented as a matrix \\\\\\\\(D\\\\\\\\), * and that `df['TSLA']` are observations of some random variable \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\), * and `df['NVDA']` are observations of some random variable \\\\\\\\(Y\\\\\\\\). Let \\\\\\\\(D\\\\\\\\) have \\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\) rows (i.e., \\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\) observations). Now, let us subtract from each column its mean, to form a new matrix \\\\\\\\(\\\\tilde{D}\\\\\\\\). In the new matrix \\\\\\\\(\\\\tilde{D}\\\\\\\\), every column has zero mean. Then notice the following: the Covariance matrix of \\\\\\\\((X, Y)\\\\\\\\) is simply \\\\\\\\(\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\tilde{D}^T\\\\tilde{D}\\\\\\\\). To see this compute \\\\\\\\[\\\\begin{align*} \\\\text{Cov}(X,Y) &= E\\\\left[(X-\\\\mu_X)(Y-\\\\mu_Y)\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{m} \\\\sum_i (\\\\tilde{D}_{i1} \\\\cdot \\\\tilde{D}_{i2})\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\;\\\\tilde{d}_1^T\\\\tilde{d}_2, \\\\end{align*}\\\\\\\\] where \\\\\\\\(\\\\tilde{d}_1\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(\\\\tilde{d}_2\\\\\\\\) are the columns of \\\\\\\\(\\\\tilde{D}\\\\\\\\). This shows that **covariance is actually an inner product** between normalized observation vectors. ## Low and High Variability Historically, most sources of random variation that have concerned statisticians are instances of low variability. The original roots of probability in the study of games of chance, and later in the study of biology and medicine, have mainly studied objects with low variability. Note that by \\u201clow variability\\u201d I don\\u2019t mean that such variability is unimportant. Some examples of random variation in this category are: * the heights of adult humans, * the number of trees per unit area in a mature forest, * the sum of 10 rolls of a die, * the time between emission of subatomic particles from a radioactive material. In each of these cases, there are a range of values that are \\u201ctypical,\\u201d and there is a clear threshold above what is typical, that essentially never occurs. On the other hand, there are some situations in which variability is quite different. In these cases, there is no real \\u201ctypical\\u201d range of values, and arbitrarily large values can occur with non-negligible frequency. Some examples in this category are * the distribution of wealth among individuals in society, * the sizes of human settlements, * the areas burnt in forest fires, * the runs of gains and losses in various financial markets over time, * and the number of collaborators a scholar has over their lifetime. ### Example > The banking system (betting against rare events) just lost [more than] 1 > Trillion dollars (so far) on a single error, more than was ever earned in > the history of banking. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, September 2008 ![](figs/derivatives-portfolio-variation.png) An example of a run of observations showing high variability. This figure shows the daily variations in a derivatives portfolio over the time-frame 1988-2008. About 99% of the variation over the 20 years occurs in a single day (the day the European Monetary System collapsed). # Important Distributions ## Important Distributions Now we will review certain distributions that come up over and over again in typical situations. ### The Bernoulli Distribution An experiment of a particularly simple type is one in which there are only two possible outcomes, such as * head or tail * success or failure * defective or non-defective component * patient recovers or does not recover Each distribution has one or more _parameters_. Parameters are settings that control the distribution. A Bernoulli distribution has one parameter, \\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\), which is the probability that the random variable is equal to 1. **Definition.** It is said that a random variable \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\) has a _Bernoulli distribution_ with parameter \\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\) \\\\\\\\((0\\\\leq p \\\\leq 1)\\\\\\\\) if \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\) can take only the values 0 and 1 and the corresponding probabilities are \\\\\\\\[P(X=1) = p \\\\: \\\\text{ and } \\\\: P(X=0) = 1-p.\\\\\\\\] Note that there is a particularly concise way of writing the above definition: \\\\\\\\[ p(x) = P(X=x) = p^x (1-p)^{(1-x)} \\\\: \\\\text{ for } \\\\: x = 0 \\\\text{ and } x=1.\\\\\\\\] The mean of a \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\) is \\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\) and the variance of \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\) is \\\\\\\\(p(1-p)\\\\\\\\). ### The Binomial Distribution The binomial distribution considers precisely \\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\) Bernoulli trials. Each trial has the probability of a success equal to \\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\). \\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\) are the parameters of the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution answers the question \\u201cWhat is the probability there will be \\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\) successes in \\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\) trials?\\u201d **Definition.** If \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\) represents the number of successes that occur in \\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\) trials, then \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\) is said to have a _binomial distribution_ with parameters \\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\) \\\\\\\\((0\\\\leq p \\\\leq 1)\\\\\\\\). The PMF of a binomial random variable is given by \\\\\\\\[p(k) = P(X=k) = \\\\binom{N}{k}\\\\; p^k\\\\; (1-p)^{N-k} \\\\: \\\\text{ for } k=0,1,\\\\ldots,N.\\\\\\\\] The validity of the above PMF can be verified as follows. First we notice, that, by the assumed independence of trials, for any **given** sequence of \\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\) successes and \\\\\\\\(N-k\\\\\\\\) failures, the probability is \\\\\\\\(p^k \\\\;(1-p)^{N-k}\\\\\\\\). Then there are \\\\\\\\(\\\\binom{N}{k}\\\\\\\\) different sequences of the \\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\) outcomes leading to \\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\) successes and \\\\\\\\(N-k\\\\\\\\) failures. The mean of the Binomial distribution is \\\\\\\\(pN\\\\\\\\), and its variance is \\\\\\\\(p(1-p)N\\\\\\\\). The PMF of the Binomial distribution with \\\\\\\\(N = 10\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\(p=0.3\\\\\\\\) is shown below. Code   from scipy.stats import binom  p = 0.3  x = np.arange(binom.ppf(0.01, 10, p), binom.ppf(0.9995, 10, p))  plt.ylim([0, 0.4])  plt.xlim([-0.5, max(x)+0.5])  plt.plot(x, binom.pmf(x, 10, p), 'bo', ms=8, label = 'binom pmf')  plt.vlines(x, 0, binom.pmf(x, 10, p), colors='b', lw = 5, alpha=0.6)  plt.title(f'Binomial PDF, $p$ = {p}, $N$ = 10', size=14)  plt.xlabel(r'$k$', size=14)  plt.ylabel(r'$P(X = k)$', size=14)  plt.show()__ ![](03-Probability-and-Statistics-Refresher_files/figure- html/cell-11-output-1.png) ### The Geometric Distribution The geometric distribution concerns Bernoulli trials as well. It has only one parameter \\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\), the probability of success. The geometric distribution answers the question: \\u201cWhat is the probability it takes \\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\) trials to obtain the first success?\\u201d **Definition.** It is said that a random variable \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\) has a _geometric distribution_ with parameter \\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\) \\\\\\\\((0\\\\leq p \\\\leq 1)\\\\\\\\) if \\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\) has a discrete distribution with \\\\\\\\[ p(k) = P(X = k) = p(1-p)^{k-1} \\\\qquad \\\\text{for} \\\\: k \\\\geq 1.\\\\\\\\] The mean of the geometric distribution is equal to \\\\\\\\(\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\\\\\) and its variance is \\\\\\\\(\\\\frac{1-p}{p^2}\\\\\\\\). An example of the geometric PMF is given below. Code   from scipy.stats import geom  p = 0.3  x = np.arange(geom.ppf(0.01, p), geom.ppf(0.995, p))  plt.ylim([0, 0.4])  plt.xlim([0.5, max(x)])  plt.plot(x, geom.pmf(x, p), 'bo', ms=8, label = 'geom pmf')  plt.vlines(x, 0, geom.pmf(x, p), colors='b', lw = 5, alpha = 0.6)  plt.title(f'Geometric PDF, $p$ = {p}', size=14)  plt.xlabel(r'$k$', size=14)  plt.ylabel(r'$P(X = k)$', size=14)  plt.show()__ ![](03-Probability-and-Statistics-Refresher_files/figure- html/cell-12-output-1.png) ### The Poisson Distribution Although the Bernoulli trials underlie all of the previous distributions, they do not form the basis for the Poisson distribution. To introduce the Poisson distribution we will look at some examples of random variables that generally obey the Poisson probability law: 1.\\n\\nAll the operations below return a new Series or DataFrame, which itself can be treated the same way as all Series and DataFrames we have seen so far. tmp_high = df.high > 45  tmp_high.tail()__   Date  2023-12-22 True  2023-12-26 True  2023-12-27 True  2023-12-28 True  2023-12-29 True  Name: high, dtype: bool Summing a Boolean array is the same as counting the number of `True` values. sum(tmp_high)__   87 * * * Now, let\\u2019s select only the rows of `df` that correspond to `tmp_high`. __ Note We can pass a series to the dataframe to select rows. df[tmp_high]__ | open | high | low | close | adj_close | volume ---|---|---|---|---|---|--- Date | | | | | | 2023-07-13 | 44.518002 | 46.154999 | 44.492001 | 45.977001 | 45.959309 | 478204000 2023-07-14 | 46.583000 | 48.088001 | 45.060001 | 45.469002 | 45.451504 | 772075000 2023-07-17 | 46.289001 | 46.495998 | 45.262001 | 46.460999 | 46.443123 | 510488000 2023-07-18 | 46.701000 | 47.896000 | 45.734001 | 47.493999 | 47.475723 | 569164000 2023-07-19 | 47.464001 | 47.818001 | 46.742001 | 47.077000 | 47.058884 | 427502000 ... | ...\\n\\nAnswer the student's question below in a friendly, concise, and engaging manner.

It\\u2019s a great way to discover patterns in stock prices or trading behaviors. \\\\n\\\\nTo get started, think about what features you would like to use from the stock data. Common features could include historical prices, trading volume, or even technical indicators like moving averages. \\\\n\\\\nOnce you have your dataset ready, you can apply the K-Means algorithm to group similar stocks based on those features. Remember, the algorithm will partition the stocks into \\\\\\\\( k \\\\\\\\) clusters, where each stock is assigned to the cluster with the nearest centroid. \\\\n\\\\nDo you have a specific stock dataset in mind, or are you looking for guidance on how to choose the right features?\\\\nStudent: For the NVIDIA dataset I need to do. Just give me an idea\\\\nAI Tutor: Great choice with the NVIDIA dataset! To start off with K-Means clustering, think about what aspects of NVIDIA\\u2019s stock data you want to analyze. Here are a few ideas to get your creativity flowing:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Historical Prices**: You could use daily closing prices or daily returns to see how the stock behaves over time.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Trading Volume**: Including trading volume can help you understand how liquidity affects price clustering.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Technical Indicators**: Consider calculating indicators like moving averages or Relative Strength Index (RSI). These can provide insights into market trends.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you've decided on your features, you can run the K-Means algorithm. Remember, you\\u2019ll need to pick a value for \\\\\\\\( k \\\\\\\\), the number of clusters, which can often be determined through techniques like the Elbow Method. \\\\n\\\\nAfter clustering, take a look at how the stocks are grouped and see if you can identify any patterns or trends. What do you think? Do any specific features stand out to you that you might want to use?\\\\n\\\\nContext:\\\\n#### Let's take a look at the data types present in the dataset. ```python df.dtypes ``` ```python df.columns ```\\\\n\\\\nWe will also typically organize the observations into a vector. Recall our stock data: Code   df.head()__ | TSLA | NVDA ---|---|--- Date | | 2023-01-03 | 108.099998 | 14.315 2023-01-04 | 113.639999 | 14.749 2023-01-05 | 110.339996 | 14.265 2023-01-06 | 113.059998 | 14.859 2023-01-09 | 119.769997 | 15.628 Each column can be treated as a vector. So: * Let\\u2019s say that our data frame `df` is represented as a matrix \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(D\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), * and that `df['TSLA']` are observations of some random variable \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), * and `df['NVDA']` are observations of some random variable \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(Y\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). Let \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(D\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) have \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) rows (i.e., \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(m\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) observations). Now, let us subtract from each column its mean, to form a new matrix \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\tilde{D}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). In the new matrix \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\tilde{D}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), every column has zero mean. Then notice the following: the Covariance matrix of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\((X, Y)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is simply \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\\\\\tilde{D}^T\\\\\\\\tilde{D}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). To see this compute \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[\\\\\\\\begin{align*} \\\\\\\\text{Cov}(X,Y) &= E\\\\\\\\left[(X-\\\\\\\\mu_X)(Y-\\\\\\\\mu_Y)\\\\\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\\\\\frac{1}{m} \\\\\\\\sum_i (\\\\\\\\tilde{D}_{i1} \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\\\\\tilde{D}_{i2})\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\\\\\;\\\\\\\\tilde{d}_1^T\\\\\\\\tilde{d}_2, \\\\\\\\end{align*}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] where \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\tilde{d}_1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\tilde{d}_2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) are the columns of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\tilde{D}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). This shows that **covariance is actually an inner product** between normalized observation vectors. ## Low and High Variability Historically, most sources of random variation that have concerned statisticians are instances of low variability. The original roots of probability in the study of games of chance, and later in the study of biology and medicine, have mainly studied objects with low variability. Note that by \\u201clow variability\\u201d I don\\u2019t mean that such variability is unimportant. Some examples of random variation in this category are: * the heights of adult humans, * the number of trees per unit area in a mature forest, * the sum of 10 rolls of a die, * the time between emission of subatomic particles from a radioactive material. In each of these cases, there are a range of values that are \\u201ctypical,\\u201d and there is a clear threshold above what is typical, that essentially never occurs. On the other hand, there are some situations in which variability is quite different. In these cases, there is no real \\u201ctypical\\u201d range of values, and arbitrarily large values can occur with non-negligible frequency. Some examples in this category are * the distribution of wealth among individuals in society, * the sizes of human settlements, * the areas burnt in forest fires, * the runs of gains and losses in various financial markets over time, * and the number of collaborators a scholar has over their lifetime. ### Example > The banking system (betting against rare events) just lost [more than] 1 > Trillion dollars (so far) on a single error, more than was ever earned in > the history of banking. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, September 2008 ![](figs/derivatives-portfolio-variation.png) An example of a run of observations showing high variability. This figure shows the daily variations in a derivatives portfolio over the time-frame 1988-2008. About 99% of the variation over the 20 years occurs in a single day (the day the European Monetary System collapsed). # Important Distributions ## Important Distributions Now we will review certain distributions that come up over and over again in typical situations. ### The Bernoulli Distribution An experiment of a particularly simple type is one in which there are only two possible outcomes, such as * head or tail * success or failure * defective or non-defective component * patient recovers or does not recover Each distribution has one or more _parameters_. Parameters are settings that control the distribution. A Bernoulli distribution has one parameter, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), which is the probability that the random variable is equal to 1. **Definition.** It is said that a random variable \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) has a _Bernoulli distribution_ with parameter \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\((0\\\\\\\\leq p \\\\\\\\leq 1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) can take only the values 0 and 1 and the corresponding probabilities are \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[P(X=1) = p \\\\\\\\: \\\\\\\\text{ and } \\\\\\\\: P(X=0) = 1-p.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] Note that there is a particularly concise way of writing the above definition: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[ p(x) = P(X=x) = p^x (1-p)^{(1-x)} \\\\\\\\: \\\\\\\\text{ for } \\\\\\\\: x = 0 \\\\\\\\text{ and } x=1.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] The mean of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and the variance of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p(1-p)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). ### The Binomial Distribution The binomial distribution considers precisely \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) Bernoulli trials. Each trial has the probability of a success equal to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) are the parameters of the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution answers the question \\u201cWhat is the probability there will be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) successes in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) trials?\\u201d **Definition.** If \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) represents the number of successes that occur in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) trials, then \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is said to have a _binomial distribution_ with parameters \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\((0\\\\\\\\leq p \\\\\\\\leq 1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). The PMF of a binomial random variable is given by \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[p(k) = P(X=k) = \\\\\\\\binom{N}{k}\\\\\\\\; p^k\\\\\\\\; (1-p)^{N-k} \\\\\\\\: \\\\\\\\text{ for } k=0,1,\\\\\\\\ldots,N.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] The validity of the above PMF can be verified as follows. First we notice, that, by the assumed independence of trials, for any **given** sequence of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) successes and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N-k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) failures, the probability is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p^k \\\\\\\\;(1-p)^{N-k}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). Then there are \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\binom{N}{k}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) different sequences of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) outcomes leading to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) successes and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N-k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) failures. The mean of the Binomial distribution is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(pN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), and its variance is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p(1-p)N\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). The PMF of the Binomial distribution with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(N = 10\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p=0.3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) is shown below. Code   from scipy.stats import binom  p = 0.3  x = np.arange(binom.ppf(0.01, 10, p), binom.ppf(0.9995, 10, p))  plt.ylim([0, 0.4])  plt.xlim([-0.5, max(x)+0.5])  plt.plot(x, binom.pmf(x, 10, p), 'bo', ms=8, label = 'binom pmf')  plt.vlines(x, 0, binom.pmf(x, 10, p), colors='b', lw = 5, alpha=0.6)  plt.title(f'Binomial PDF, $p$ = {p}, $N$ = 10', size=14)  plt.xlabel(r'$k$', size=14)  plt.ylabel(r'$P(X = k)$', size=14)  plt.show()__ ![](03-Probability-and-Statistics-Refresher_files/figure- html/cell-11-output-1.png) ### The Geometric Distribution The geometric distribution concerns Bernoulli trials as well. It has only one parameter \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\), the probability of success. The geometric distribution answers the question: \\u201cWhat is the probability it takes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(k\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) trials to obtain the first success?\\u201d **Definition.** It is said that a random variable \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) has a _geometric distribution_ with parameter \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\((0\\\\\\\\leq p \\\\\\\\leq 1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) has a discrete distribution with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[ p(k) = P(X = k) = p(1-p)^{k-1} \\\\\\\\qquad \\\\\\\\text{for} \\\\\\\\: k \\\\\\\\geq 1.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\] The mean of the geometric distribution is equal to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\) and its variance is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\frac{1-p}{p^2}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\). An example of the geometric PMF is given below. Code   from scipy.stats import geom  p = 0.3  x = np.arange(geom.ppf(0.01, p), geom.ppf(0.995, p))  plt.ylim([0, 0.4])  plt.xlim([0.5, max(x)])  plt.plot(x, geom.pmf(x, p), 'bo', ms=8, label = 'geom pmf')  plt.vlines(x, 0, geom.pmf(x, p), colors='b', lw = 5, alpha = 0.6)  plt.title(f'Geometric PDF, $p$ = {p}', size=14)  plt.xlabel(r'$k$', size=14)  plt.ylabel(r'$P(X = k)$', size=14)  plt.show()__ ![](03-Probability-and-Statistics-Refresher_files/figure- html/cell-12-output-1.png) ### The Poisson Distribution Although the Bernoulli trials underlie all of the previous distributions, they do not form the basis for the Poisson distribution.

It\\u2019s a great way to discover patterns in stock prices or trading behaviors. \\n\\nTo get started, think about what features you would like to use from the stock data. Common features could include historical prices, trading volume, or even technical indicators like moving averages. \\n\\nOnce you have your dataset ready, you can apply the K-Means algorithm to group similar stocks based on those features. Remember, the algorithm will partition the stocks into \\\\( k \\\\) clusters, where each stock is assigned to the cluster with the nearest centroid. \\n\\nDo you have a specific stock dataset in mind, or are you looking for guidance on how to choose the right features?\\nStudent: For the NVIDIA dataset I need to do.

These can provide insights into market trends.\\n\\nOnce you've decided on your features, you can run the K-Means algorithm.

Make sure to handle any missing values and decide which features (like \\\"Open\\\", \\\"Close\\\", \\\"Volume\\\", etc.) you want to include in your clustering.\\n\\n2. **Feature Scaling**: Since K-Means is sensitive to the scale of the data, it\\u2019s a good idea to normalize or standardize your features. This ensures that no single feature dominates the distance calculations.\\n\\n3. **Choose \\\\( k \\\\)**: You\\u2019ll need to determine the number of clusters, \\\\( k \\\\). One common method is the Elbow Method, where you plot the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) against different values of \\\\( k \\\\) and look for a point where the rate of decrease sharply changes.\\n\\n4. **Run K-Means**: Using a library like Scikit-learn in Python, you can easily implement the algorithm. You'll instantiate the KMeans class and fit it to your data. \\n\\n   Here\\u2019s a quick snippet to get you started:\\n   ```python\\n   from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\\n   kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k)\\n   kmeans.fit(data)\\n   ```\\n\\n5. **Analyze Results**: After fitting the model, check the cluster labels and centroids. You can visualize the clusters to see how your stocks are grouped.\\n\\n6. **Interpretation**: Dive into the clusters and interpret what they mean.

Here's a roadmap to guide you:\\n\\n1. **Prepare Your Data**: Start by cleaning your NVIDIA dataset. Make sure to handle any missing values and decide which features (like \\\"Open\\\", \\\"Close\\\", \\\"Volume\\\", etc.) you want to include in your clustering.\\n\\n2. **Feature Scaling**: Since K-Means is sensitive to the scale of the data, it\\u2019s a good idea to normalize or standardize your features. This ensures that no single feature dominates the distance calculations.\\n\\n3. **Choose \\\\( k \\\\)**: You\\u2019ll need to determine the number of clusters, \\\\( k \\\\). One common method is the Elbow Method, where you plot the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) against different values of \\\\( k \\\\) and look for a point where the rate of decrease sharply changes.\\n\\n4. **Run K-Means**: Using a library like Scikit-learn in Python, you can easily implement the algorithm.

You can visualize the clusters to see how your stocks are grouped.\\n\\n6. **Interpretation**: Dive into the clusters and interpret what they mean.

It\\u2019s a great way to discover patterns in stock prices or trading behaviors. \\n\\nTo get started, think about what features you would like to use from the stock data. Common features could include historical prices, trading volume, or even technical indicators like moving averages. \\n\\nOnce you have your dataset ready, you can apply the K-Means algorithm to group similar stocks based on those features. Remember, the algorithm will partition the stocks into \\\\( k \\\\) clusters, where each stock is assigned to the cluster with the nearest centroid. \\n\\nDo you have a specific stock dataset in mind, or are you looking for guidance on how to choose the right features?\\nStudent: For the NVIDIA dataset I need to do. Just give me an idea\\nAI Tutor: Great choice with the NVIDIA dataset! To start off with K-Means clustering, think about what aspects of NVIDIA\\u2019s stock data you want to analyze. Here are a few ideas to get your creativity flowing:\\n\\n1. **Historical Prices**: You could use daily closing prices or daily returns to see how the stock behaves over time.\\n\\n2. **Trading Volume**: Including trading volume can help you understand how liquidity affects price clustering.\\n\\n3. **Technical Indicators**: Consider calculating indicators like moving averages or Relative Strength Index (RSI). These can provide insights into market trends.\\n\\nOnce you've decided on your features, you can run the K-Means algorithm. Remember, you\\u2019ll need to pick a value for \\\\( k \\\\), the number of clusters, which can often be determined through techniques like the Elbow Method. \\n\\nAfter clustering, take a look at how the stocks are grouped and see if you can identify any patterns or trends. What do you think? Do any specific features stand out to you that you might want to use?\\nStudent: Date\\tOpen\\tHigh\\tLow\\tClose\\tAdj-Close\\tVolume\\n\\nExplain these parameters\\nAI Tutor: Sure! Let's break down those parameters you see in the stock dataset:\\n\\n1. **Date**: This column represents the specific trading day. It helps in tracking how the stock price changes over time.\\n\\n2. **Open**: This is the price at which the stock started trading for that day. It gives you an idea of how the market felt about the stock at the beginning of the trading session.\\n\\n3. **High**: This column shows the highest price reached by the stock during the trading day. It can indicate how much demand there was for the stock.\\n\\n4. **Low**: This represents the lowest price at which the stock traded during the day. It helps you understand the price fluctuations throughout the day.\\n\\n5. **Close**: This is the price of the stock at the end of the trading day. It's often used as a benchmark to compare performance over time.\\n\\n6. **Adj-Close**: The adjusted close price takes into account any dividends and stock splits, giving a more accurate representation of a stock's value over time. This is particularly useful for long-term analysis.\\n\\n7. **Volume**: This indicates the number of shares traded during the day. Higher volume can signify stronger investor interest.\\n\\nUnderstanding these parameters will give you valuable insights into the stock's performance.

Here's a roadmap to guide you:\\n\\n1. **Prepare Your Data**: Start by cleaning your NVIDIA dataset. Make sure to handle any missing values and decide which features (like \\\"Open\\\", \\\"Close\\\", \\\"Volume\\\", etc.) you want to include in your clustering.\\n\\n2. **Feature Scaling**: Since K-Means is sensitive to the scale of the data, it\\u2019s a good idea to normalize or standardize your features. This ensures that no single feature dominates the distance calculations.\\n\\n3. **Choose \\\\( k \\\\)**: You\\u2019ll need to determine the number of clusters, \\\\( k \\\\). One common method is the Elbow Method, where you plot the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) against different values of \\\\( k \\\\) and look for a point where the rate of decrease sharply changes.\\n\\n4. **Run K-Means**: Using a library like Scikit-learn in Python, you can easily implement the algorithm. You'll instantiate the KMeans class and fit it to your data. \\n\\n   Here\\u2019s a quick snippet to get you started:\\n   ```python\\n   from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\\n   kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k)\\n   kmeans.fit(data)\\n   ```\\n\\n5. **Analyze Results**: After fitting the model, check the cluster labels and centroids. You can visualize the clusters to see how your stocks are grouped.\\n\\n6. **Interpretation**: Dive into the clusters and interpret what they mean. Are there any obvious patterns based on the features you selected?\\n\\nWhat features are you thinking about using for your clustering? Or do you need help with any of these steps?\\n\\n<footer><span style=\\\"font-size: 0.8em; text-align: right; display: block;\\\">Tokens Left: 42709</span></footer>\\n\"\n",
